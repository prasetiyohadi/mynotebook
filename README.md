# My Notebook

Collection of my jupyter notebooks.

## Getting Started

Use poetry to setup the environment.
```
poetry install
poetry shell
jupyter notebook
```

The notebooks are stored inside `notebooks` directory. For using notebook with
kernel other than python such as julia, you need manually install julia on your
environment.
